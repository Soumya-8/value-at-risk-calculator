# 📉 Value at Risk (VaR) Calculator

This project provides a simple and interactive Value at Risk (VaR) calculator built using Python. It allows users to estimate the potential loss in the value of a financial portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval.

## 💡 What is Value at Risk?

**Value at Risk (VaR)** is a widely used risk measure in finance that quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a specified time period, under normal market conditions, at a given confidence level.

For example:  
> "With 95% confidence, the portfolio will not lose more than ₹50,000 over the next 10 days."
