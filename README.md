# 💰 Value at Risk (VaR) Calculator

This project implements a Value at Risk (VaR) calculator using two widely-used methods:

- 📉 **Historical Method**  
- 🧠 **Parametric (Gaussian) Method**

---

## 📊 What is Value at Risk?

**VaR** measures the potential loss in value of an asset or portfolio over a given time period with a certain confidence level.

> Example:  
> _"There is a 95% chance the portfolio will not lose more than ₹X in a day."_
